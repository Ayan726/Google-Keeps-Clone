# Google-Keeps-Clone
This is a simple clone of Google Keep, built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, a search filter, dark mode, and reminders. It uses LocalStorage to store page states, such as notes and user preferences.

# Getting Started
To get started with the application, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-keep-clone.git

Then, open the index.html file in your web browser to access the application.

# Features
The Google Keep clone has the following features:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete notes
- Search notes by keyword
- Set reminders for notes
- Toggle dark mode for the application
- Automatically saves notes and preferences to LocalStorage

# Usage
- To create a new note, click on the "Add Notes" button on the top right corner of the page. You can then enter a description for the note and click the "Save" button to add it to the list of notes.

- To edit a note, click on the note's edit button to open it in the edit mode. You can then make changes to the note and click the "Save" button to update it.

- To delete a note, click on the trash icon next to the note.

- To search for a note, enter a keyword in the search bar on the top of the page. The application will filter the notes based on the keyword.

- To set a reminder for a note, click on the clock icon next to the note's title. You can then select a time for the reminder and click the "Notify" button.

- To toggle dark mode for the application, click on the moon icon on the top right corner of the page.

# LocalStorage
The application uses LocalStorage to store the user's notes and preferences. This means that the notes and settings will persist even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page. However, note that LocalStorage has a limit of 5-10 MB depending on the browser, so the user may run out of storage if they create too many notes.
